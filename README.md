# Welcome

Hi! I'm Matthew Rogers, a recent graduate of Virginia Tech with a Bachelors in statistics. This github is a collection of the various coding and statistical projects that I've done in the past, or am currently working on. The projects are presented as Jupyter notebooks for easier viewing.

This github is intended to be supplimentary material to my resume and cover letter for job applications. If you have questions about any projects listed here, please feel free to reach out to me at my email: rmatt98@vt.edu
